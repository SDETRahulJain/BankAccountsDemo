Readme.md for Bank Account Management API Automation
This document provides an overview of the Bank Account Management API automation code base.

1. Overview:
This project implements a simple API automation framework for testing single-entry bank account functionalities like creation, deletion, deposit, and withdrawal.

2. Tech Stack:
C# (.NET Framework)
SpecFlow for BDD test automation
RestSharp for API calls
Newtonsoft.Json for JSON serialization/deserialization
NUnit for unit testing

3. Features:
Create new account with initial balance and name.
Delete existing account by account number.
Deposit money to an existing account.
Withdraw money from an existing account (within available balance).

4. Test Coverage:
Each feature scenario is covered by a corresponding SpecFlow step definition with NUnit assertions.
Tests verify responses for success codes, error messages, data values, and expected behavior.

5. Usage:
Build the project using Visual Studio or the dotnet build command.
Run tests using the NUnit Test Runner or the dotnet test command.

6. Directory Structure:
Features: Feature files containing scenarios.
StepDefinitions: C# code implementing steps from features.
Models: Classes representing request and response data.
Util: Helper class for serialization, API calls, and deserialization.
Tests: NUnit test project for running assertions.
Readme.md: This documentation file.

7. Notes:
This is a basic example and can be extended to include more functionalities and complex scenarios.
Consider implementing API documentation and security measures for production use.
